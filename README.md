This project introduces an innovative approach to network intrusion detection by integrating a real-time monitoring system with a machine learning-based stacking ensemble model. Unlike traditional NIDS, which often rely on singular or shallow models, this system combines multiple base models—including Gradient Boosting, XGB, LightGBM, CatBoost, and MLP—under a meta-classifier (XGB classifier) to improve both the accuracy and robustness of threat detection. By adopting a stacking ensemble, the model capitalizes on the strengths of various algorithms, allowing it to detect a wide range of anomalous behaviours with higher precision than standalone models.
Another unique aspect of this project is its use of a web-based real-time monitoring interface, which allows security analysts to observe network traffic and detect potential threats as they occur. The front end visualizes crucial network metrics, using protocol features (such as connection duration, error rates, and bytes transferred) to provide granular insights into each data point. This live data visualization is not only valuable for intrusion detection but also for understanding network health over time.

Dataset: network_intrusion.csv

The dataset used for this project comprises various features essential for detecting network intrusions, containing both normal and anomalous records. Key attributes include network traffic details such as duration, protocol_type, service, flag, src_bytes, dst_bytes, and various error rates (e.g., serror_rate, srv_rerror_rate). Each record is classified as either "normal" or "anomaly."
The dataset is structured to capture the characteristics of legitimate network connections as well as patterns associated with attacks, making it suitable for training machine learning models. The diversity of features helps the stacking ensemble model detect different types of intrusions, from frequent attacks to rare anomalies. Additionally, using this dataset enables the model to learn from diverse patterns and build a robust defence against a wide array of network threats.
